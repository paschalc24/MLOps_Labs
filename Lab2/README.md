In this lab I changed the dataset to credit-g from openml to view datadrift.

Steps to run:
1. Retrieve an Evidently AI Cloud Workspace token and use it in place of the CLOUD_WORKSPACE_TOKEN env variable. The one used for class can be found [here](https://github.com/paschalc24/MLOps_Labs/blob/main/Lab2/Lab1.ipynb)
3. pip install evidently
4. Run each cell in Lab1.ipynb in order.
